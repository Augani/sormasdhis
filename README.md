# Project SORMAS-DHIS2

## Project Objectives
DHIS2 has been adopted by more than 60 African countries as a National Health Information System. All relevant data should be stored and managed on this system. DHIS2 can receive, store and share data from various data sources to other systems and reporting platforms. DHIS2 can exchange data with other software applications and platforms. This interoperability enables collaboration with various software platforms and the integration of data sources from other applications. SORMAS and DHIS2 will be connected to provide a data exchange between these systems. The purpose of data exchange is to improve the control and management of infectious diseases and to allow timely initiation of disease control. The goal of this software project is to create a dynamic, custom API that is specifically designed to transfer data between SORMAS and DHIS2.
